CPSC 4720 Mandela Effect Game Project

Developers:

This project is based of the idea of the mandela effect, where the influence of culture or another external force cause a large group of people to remember something incorrectly. Some specific examples of this is if curious george has a tail and whether the cartoon is spelled Looney Toons or Looney Tunes.
